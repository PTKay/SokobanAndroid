# SokobanAndroid
An Android port of the [previously developed](https://github.com/PTKickass/Sokoban) PC version of Sokoban, using libraries made by the teacher.

Developed as the final project of the Object Oriented Programming class (2nd semester) at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/).

## Overview
Sokoban is a puzzle video game genre in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations. 

This application was developed for Android with the use of a library provided by the teachers.

The game allows for custom levels to be designed through the [`levels.txt`](/Sokoban/app/src/main/assets/levels.txt) file.
